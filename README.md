# predict-sales

In this project I wanted to predict sales of items in one month period. The task is to forecast the total amount of products sold in every shop for the test set. Dataset was downloaded from kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/c/competitive-data-science-predict-future-sales/data. After data analysis and preprocessing, I used several models to train on data. The best model was used to predict on submission sample.
